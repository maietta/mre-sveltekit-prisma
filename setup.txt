The following steps were taken to set this project up:

Create project:
bun create svelte@latest
    (Choose ESLint, Prettier, Experimental Svelte 5 support)

Switch the adaptor:
bun add -d svelte-adapter-bun
    (Modify the svelte.config.js to refernce the svelte-adapter-bun)

Add Prisma CLI & Client
bun add -D prisma
bun prisma init

Run the SQL create script found in sql/ to create some sample tables.

Introspect the database to create a local Prisma schema.
bun prisma db pull

Now we are ready for setting up our application.

Add the Prisma Client dependency and generate the local client interface, which by default is included in node_modules/
bun add @prisma/client
